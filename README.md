# QA Expert Agent (ISTQB Mentor)

A local AI agent that turns ISTQB certification material into an interactive QA mentor.

The agent answers software testing questions, explains testing concepts, and suggests practical test cases — grounded only in retrieved ISTQB documentation.

This project is intentionally built from primitives (without LangChain or orchestration frameworks) to understand how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agents actually work.

The system runs fully locally using mimik AI Foundation with models served via the mimoe runtime.

## ⚠️ AI Development Rules

This repository contains a `CLAUDE.md` file designed for use with Claude Code.

It defines strict development rules for AI-assisted coding sessions, including:

- One deliverable per step
- Mandatory review checkpoints
- Small, testable increments
- No hidden abstractions

If you plan to contribute or use Claude Code with this repository, read `CLAUDE.md` first.

## Project Goals

This project exists for three main purposes.

### 1. Learn AI Engineering Fundamentals

Build an AI system from the ground up by implementing:

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document chunking
- Embeddings
- Vector search
- Agent orchestration
- Prompt design

All components are implemented without high-level AI frameworks.

### 2. Improve QA Expertise

The system turns ISTQB study material into an interactive QA mentor. It helps:

- Explain testing concepts
- Generate realistic test ideas
- Practice interview explanations
- Reinforce ISTQB terminology

### 3. Build a Portfolio Project

This repository demonstrates skills in:

- Python engineering
- AI agent systems
- Local LLM workflows
- RAG architectures
- QA domain expertise

## What the Agent Does

The QA Expert Agent behaves like a Senior QA Engineer with 15+ years of experience mentoring a junior tester.

When you ask a question, the system:

1. Searches ISTQB material stored in a vector database
2. Retrieves the most relevant sections
3. Sends the retrieved context to a local LLM
4. Generates a structured explanation

### Response Format (5-part model)

- **Definition** — ISTQB concept explanation
- **Real project example** — practical usage
- **Suggested test cases** — actionable tests
- **Common mistakes** — pitfalls
- **Interview explanation** — how to explain in interviews

The agent cites retrieved context and avoids hallucinations.

## Architecture

The system follows a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.13
- Poetry 2.x
- mimik AI Foundation runtime
- VS Code

The mimik runtime must be running on `http://localhost:8083`.

### First-time Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiVamsiKolla-QA/qa-agent.git
cd qa-expert-agent
poetry install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set `MODEL_NAME` to the model name reported by your mimik runtime.

### Start the Runtime

```bash
mimoe start
mimoe status
```

### Connectivity Test

```bash
poetry run qa-agent ping
```

Expected output:

```
mimik reachable. model reply: ...
```

### Ingest ISTQB Material

Place PDFs in `data/istqb_docs/`, then run:

```bash
poetry run qa-agent ingest data/istqb_docs/<filename>.pdf
```

### Ask Questions

Step 9 will add a `qa-agent ask` command for grounded QA answers — currently in development.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest -m integration
```

### Golden RAG Tests

Validates concept correctness, ISTQB terminology coverage, and absence of hallucinations.

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/golden/
```

## Why No AI Frameworks?

This project intentionally avoids LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph.

The goal is to understand how RAG systems work internally — not to wrap a framework.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status  | Description                              |

| 2     | Planned | Test case generator agent (BVA, EP, decision tables) |
| 3     | Planned | QA interview coach with answer evaluation |
| 4     | Planned | FastAPI service + optional web UI        |
